    "\n",
    "Plonk uses the fact that polynomials can be uniquely represented as a vector of coefficients and as a multiset of irreducible factors to efficiently proof that one vector is a permutation of another. This is done using applications of the Schwartz-Zippel lemma.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMHO, the two key innovations in Plonk's permutation check are 1) a protocol for multiset equality checking and 2) a way of encoding a permutation check as a multiset equality check over pairs.\n",

    "Proof. Define $P(X) ≝ \\prod_{a ∈ A} (a + X)$ and $Q(X) ≝ \\prod_{b ∈ B}(b + X)$. If the above holds with non-neglible probability then by the polynomial identity corrolary we have $P = Q$. From the unique factorization of polynomials it follows that their irreducible factors are the same, which are given in their definition. From this follows $\\set A = \\set B$. □\n",
    "\n",
    "Note. We do not require $\\norm{\\set A} = \\norm{\\set B}$ and the test will correctly fail when they are of unequal size.\n",

    "Remark. Compared to lemma A.3 in the paper it is rephrased in terms of multisets and generalized to have multisets of unequal size. The protocol in chapter 5 is readily adjusted to become a multiset-equality protocol.\n",

If the above holds with non-neglible probability then by the polynomial identity corrolary we have $P = Q$. From the uniqueness of the coefficient representation of polynomials it follows that $\\forall_{i \\in [n]} a_i = b_i$ and therefore $\\vec a = \\vec b$. □\n",
    "\n",
    "Remark. If $\\vec a$ and $\\vec b$ have unequal size, the test can incorrectly pass if the final entries of the longer vector are zero, otherwise it should work correctly. The stated form requires them to be equal length. (to do: we could add a $X^{n+1}$ term to bind the length of the vector.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Proof. Since the elements $c_i$ are unique, the pairs are unique and the multisets are just regular sets. Two sets are equal iff their elements can be brought in correspondance. Enumerate the elements as above, we are looking for correspondances between elements $(a_i, c_i) ≟ (b_j, c_{𝜎(j)})$. The second element in the pair is equal only if $i = 𝜎(j)$, this means a correspondance exists iff $b_j = a_{𝜎(j)}$. □\n",
