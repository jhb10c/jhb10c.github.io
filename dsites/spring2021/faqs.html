  <h2>FAQ</h2>
    

    <p><strong>Q: I am not able to attend the live lecture sessions, labs, and/or discussions. Can I still take the course?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Although we encourage students to attend these live sessions, we realize that this is not always possible. A recorded zoom session will be available for each class. You may complete the labs ahead of time remotely. The textbook is also a great resource, though it is not a perfect substitute for discussions, labs, live lectures, and office hours.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the best way to get help in this course?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Your best avenues are to go to office hours held by the course staff, or to ask questions on Discord. Course staff will be monitoring discord frequently and will try to answer your question quickly and thoroughly.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where will our grades for assignments be displayed for the course?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Grades will be displayed on D2L. </p>
<p><strong>Q: I worked with a partner on a project, and they have a grade on D2L for the project while I do not. Why is this happening?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: If this occurs please contact your instructor.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I noticed a mistake in the grading of my homework. How can I get this fixed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: To get this fixed, you must submit a regrade request before a of the assignment deadline. This is known as the regrade request window. We unfortunately will not accept any regrades after the window has closed. </p>
<p><strong>sQ: I have some other grading questions. Who should I contact?</strong></p>
