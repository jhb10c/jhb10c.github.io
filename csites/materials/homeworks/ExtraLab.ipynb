On the other hand, a given integer N is composite if there exists an $a$ such that  $a^{N-1} \\neq 1 mod N$. An element $a\\in Z_N$ such that  $a^{N-1} \\neq 1 mod N$ is called a witness that N is composite, shortened to be witness.\n",

Since $a^{N-1} = a^{2^{r-1}u} = \\pm 1 mod N$ and it can be shown that $a^{N-1}=1 mod N$. Conversely if $a$ is a witness then it is a strong witness. \n",
